Description:

Mock University course enrollment system using JavaFX with integrated SQLite database Course Management System (CMS) Readme Overview The Course Management System (CMS) is a Java-based application built with JavaFX, SQLite, and FXML. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface for managing courses. Users can create a profile, enroll in courses, view a timetable, withdraw from courses, and export a file of enrolled courses. This readme document provides an overview of the CMS, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

Features:

Signup Page: Users can create a username and password and provide their first and last names. Each user is assigned a unique student number generated by the system.

Database Integration: User information is stored in an SQLite database. The database schema ensures uniqueness of users and tracks user enrollments in courses.

Course Enrollment: Users can view available courses and enroll by double-clicking on a course row. The system checks for timetable clashes before enrolling.

Profile Editing: Users can edit their username, first name, last name, and password (excluding the unique student number).

Enrollments Page: Users can view all courses they are currently enrolled in.

Timetable: Automatically generated timetable displays the user's class commitments over the week.

Export Enrolled Courses: Users can export their enrolled courses to a .txt file.

Show All Courses: Displays all available courses. Users can also unenroll from previously enrolled courses.

Database:
SQLite database stores student, enrollment, and course information between sessions.
User information is encrypted for security.

Configure the JavaFX library in your IDE to ensure it is recognized and accessible within the project. Refer to your IDE's documentation or online resources for specific instructions on configuring JavaFX. Database Setup:

Ensure you have SQLite installed on your system. Create a new SQLite database file (e.g., cms.db). Execute the provided SQL scripts or use an SQLite client to create the necessary tables and schema for the CMS. Configure Database Connection:

Open the CMS source code in your IDE. Locate the database connection configuration file (e.g., DBConfig.java). Update the configuration settings with the appropriate database file path, credentials, and other relevant details. Build and Run:

Build the CMS project in your IDE to compile the code. Run the CMS application, and the graphical user interface should open. Usage Once the CMS application is up and running, follow these guidelines to use its features:
