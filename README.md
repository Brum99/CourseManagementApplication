CourseManagementApplication
Description:

CourseManagementApplication is a mock university course enrollment system built using JavaFX with an integrated SQLite database. The application allows users to sign up, enroll in courses, edit their profile, view their timetable, and export enrolled courses to a .txt file.

Features:

Signup Page: Users can create a username and password and provide their first and last names. Each user is assigned a unique student number generated by the system.

Database Integration: User information is stored in an SQLite database. The database schema ensures uniqueness of users and tracks user enrollments in courses.

Course Enrollment: Users can view available courses and enroll by double-clicking on a course row. The system checks for timetable clashes before enrolling.

Profile Editing: Users can edit their username, first name, last name, and password (excluding the unique student number).

Enrollments Page: Users can view all courses they are currently enrolled in.

Timetable: Automatically generated timetable displays the user's class commitments over the week.

Export Enrolled Courses: Users can export their enrolled courses to a .txt file.

Show All Courses: Displays all available courses. Users can also unenroll from previously enrolled courses.

Database:
SQLite database stores student, enrollment, and course information between sessions.
User information is encrypted for security.
